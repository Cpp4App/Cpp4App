### Hi there 👋

This repository is for the project Contextual Privacy Policies for Mobile Apps.  

🚀 To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a novel framework, i.e., \textsc{SeePrivacy}, to automatically generate contextual privacy policies for mobile apps.

🥳 We propose a novel multi-modal framework, namely \textsc{SeePrivacy}, designed to automatically generate contextual privacy policies for mobile app. We utilize computer vision techniques and NLP techniques to extract corresponding segments from the privacy policy document.

👏 We also build the benchmark dataset, i.e., \textsc{Cpp4App}, for contextual privacy policies on mobile apps, including 600+ CPPs with their corresponding privacy policy segments.  

We are adding the code and dataset. Stay tuned! 🤞
