### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This repository is for the project Contextual Privacy Policies for Mobile Apps.  

We propose a novel multi-modal framework, namely SEEPRIVACY, designed to automatically generate contextual privacy policies for mobile app. We utilize computer vision techniques and a pre-trained Large Language Model, i.e., Chat-GPT, to detect privacy-related contexts on mobile GUI screenshots and leverage NLP techniques to extract corresponding segments from the privacy policy document.

We are adding the code and dataset. Stay tuned!
