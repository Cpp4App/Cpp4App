<h2>1 What information is collected by us and how do we use it?</h2>
<h3><strong>1.1 What information is collected by us</strong></h3>
<p>In order to provide our services to you, we will ask you to provide personal information that is necessary to provide those services to you. We will only collect the information that is necessary for specified, concrete, explicit and legitimate purposes and shall ensure that the information is not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. You have the right to choose whether or not to provide the information we have requested, but in most cases, if you do not provide your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to your queries.</p>
<p>Depending on the service you choose, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
<h4><strong>1.1.1 Information you provide to us</strong></h4>
<p>We may collect any personal information you provide to us, which is necessary for the service you choose. For example, you may provide your name, mobile phone number, email address, delivery address, order, invoicing details, bank account number, account holder name, credit card number, and other information if you use mi.com retailing services; you may sync materials or data if you use Xiaomi Cloud services; you may provide gender, your security-related information and other information if you create an account; you may provide us your nickname, email address, photos, videos or other needed information if you enter into promotional activities; you may provide name, mobile phone number and address if you engage with us, our content, or our marketing, or win a prize.</p>
<h4><strong>1.1.2 Information that we collect in your use of services</strong></h4>
<p><strong>• Device or SIM-related information.</strong> For example, IMEI number/OAID number, GAID number, IMSI number, MAC address, serial number, MIUI version and type, ROM version, Android version, Android ID, Space ID, SIM card operator and its location area, screen display information, device keypad information, device manufacturer details and model name, device activation time, network operator, connection type, basic hardware information, sales channel and usage information (such as CPU, storage, battery usage, screen resolution and device temperature, camera lens model, times of screen brightened and times of screen unlocked).</p>
<p><strong>• Information specific to you that may be assigned by third party service providers and business partners:</strong> We may collect and use the information such as your advertising ID assigned by third party service providers and business partners.</p>
<p><strong>• Information related to your application usage,</strong> including unique identifiers for application (e.g. VAID number, OAID number, AAID number, Instance ID), application basic information, such as application list, application ID information, SDK version, system update settings, application settings (region, language, time zone, font), the time the application enters/exits the foreground and application status record (e.g. downloading, installing, updating, deleting).</p>
<p><strong>• Information generated when you use a MIUI service,</strong> such as your badges, ratings, sign-in information and browsing records in Mi Community; your messages in Mi Community (only visible to both sending and receiving parties); your audio playback history and search queries in music services; your likes, comments, favorites, shares, search queries in theme services; system language, country and region, network status, list of apps in App Vault; your usage information, including region, IP, relevant content provider, wallpaper changing frequency, image views, image browsing mode, image browsing duration, clicks and exposure of articles, subscriptions in Wallpaper Carousel.</p>
<p><strong>• Location information (only for specific services/functionalities):</strong> various types of information on your accurate or approximate location if you use location-related services (navigation software, weather software, and the software with device-locating functionality). For example, region, country code, city code, mobile network code, mobile country code, cell identity, longitude and latitude information, time zone settings, language settings. You can restrict access to location information of each application at any time within the phone settings (Settings - Permissions).</p>
<p><strong>• Log information:</strong> information related to your use of certain features, apps, and websites. For example, cookies and other identifier technologies, IP addresses, network request information, temporary message history, standard system logs, crash information, log information generated by using the services (such as registration time, access time, activity time, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>• Other information:</strong> Environmental characteristics value (ECV) (i.e. value generated from Mi Account ID, device ID, connected Wi-Fi ID, and location information).</p>
<h4><strong>1.1.3 Information from third-party sources</strong></h4>
<p>When permitted by law, we will collect information about you from third-party sources. For example,</p>
<p>• for certain services that might include account and financial transactions, with your authorization, we may validate the information provided by you (such as phone number) through legitimate third-party sources for security and fraud prevention purposes;</p>
<p>• we may receive designated identifier symbols (such as IMEI/OAID/GAID from an advertiser) to provide advertising services to you;</p>
<p>• we may also obtain certain information such as account IDs, nicknames, avatar, and email address from third-party social network services (e.g. when you use a social network account to sign in to a Xiaomi service);</p>
<p>• information about you that others provided to us (e.g. your delivery address that other users may provide to us when they buy products for you via mi.com services).</p>
<h4><strong>1.1.4 Non-personally identifiable information</strong></h4>
<p>We may also collect other types of information which are not directly or indirectly linked to an individual and which may not be defined as personal information according to applicable local laws. Such information is called non-personally identifiable information. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personally identifiable information. Here are some examples of information that we collect and how we may use it in a non-personally identifiable aggregated format:</p>
<p>• We may include statistical data generated when you use a specific service (e.g. non-identifiable device related information, daily usage events, page access events, page access time events and session events);</p>
<p>• Network monitoring data (e.g. request time, number of request or error request etc.);</p>
<p>• Application crash events (e.g. the logging automatically generated after the application crashed etc.).</p>
<p>The purpose for such collecting is to improve the services we provide to you. The type and amount of information collected depends on how you use our products and/or services.</p>
<p>We aggregate such information to provide you with more useful information, and understand which parts of our websites, products and services you are most interested in. For example, we may only need the number of users who are active in a day; and we don't need to know in that day who is active, so aggregate data is enough for statistical analysis. We will endeavor to isolate your personal data from non-personally identifiable information and ensure that the two types of data are used separately. However, if we combine non-personally identifiable information with personal information, such combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>
<h3><strong>1.2 How we use the personal information that we collect</strong></h3>
<p>The purpose of collecting personal information is to provide you with products and/or services, and to ensure that we comply with applicable laws, regulations and other regulatory requirements. This involves:</p>
<p><strong>• Providing, processing, maintaining, improving and developing our products and/or services to you</strong>, such as delivery, activation, verification, after-sales, customer support, and advertising.</p>
<p><strong>• Implementing and maintaining security safeguards for the purpose of preventing loss and fraud</strong>, such as assisting in identifying users, verifying user identity. We use your information for anti-fraud purposes only when the following two conditions are met: it is necessary; and the data used for evaluation is in accordance with the legitimate interests of Xiaomi to protect users and services.</p>
<p><strong>• Handling your questions or requests about devices and services</strong>, such as answering customer inquiries, sending system and application notifications, managing your activities (e.g. sweepstakes).</p>
<p><strong>• Conducting relevant promotional activities, such as providing marketing and promotional materials and updates.</strong> If you no longer wish to receive certain types of promotional materials, you may opt-out by the method provided in the message (such as the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the message) unless otherwise specified under applicable laws. Please also see "Your rights" below.</p>
<p><strong>• Internal purposes</strong>, such as data analysis, research, and development of statistical information related to the use of our products or services to improve our products or services. For example, machine learning or model algorithm training is performed after de-identification processing.</p>
<p><strong>• Optimizing the performance of your device</strong>, such as analyzing the memory usage or the CPU utilization of your application.</p>
<p><strong>• Storing and maintaining information related to you for our business operations</strong> (such as business statistics) or <strong>for fulfilling our legal obligations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Processing based on the legitimate interests of Xiaomi (in applicable jurisdictions, for example under GDPR).</strong> Legitimate interests include enabling us to more effectively manage and operate our business and provide our products and services; protecting the security of our businesses, systems, products, services, and customers (including for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes); internal management; complying with internal policies and processes; and other legitimate interests described in this policy. For example, to ensure the security of our services, and to help us further understand the state of performance of our applications, we may record relevant information, such as the frequency of your usage, crash logs information, overall usage, performance data and source of application; to prevent unauthorized vendors unlocking devices, we may collect Mi Account, serial number and IP address of operated computer, serial number and device info of your phone.</p>
<p><strong>• Providing services locally on terminal devices</strong> that do not require communication with our servers, such as using Notes on your device.</p>
<p><strong>• Other purposes with your consent.</strong></p>
<p>Here are more detailed examples on how we use your information (which may include personal information):</p>
<p><strong>• Activating and registering your purchased Xiaomi products or services for you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Creating and maintaining your Mi Account.</strong> Personal information collected when you create a Mi Account on our websites or through our mobile devices, is used to create the personal Mi Account and profile page for you.</p>
<p><strong>• Processing your purchase order.</strong> Information related to e-commerce orders is used for processing the purchase order and related after-sales services, including customer support and re-delivery. In addition, the order number will be used to cross-check the order with the delivery partner as well as to record delivery of the parcel. Recipient information, including name, address, phone number, and postal code will be used for delivery purposes. Your email address is used to send you parcel tracking information. A list of purchased items is used for printing an invoice and enables the customer to see which items are in the parcel.</p>
<p><strong>• Participating in the Mi Community.</strong> Personal information related to the Mi Community or other Xiaomi Internet platforms may be used for profile page display, interaction with other users, and participating in the Mi Community.</p>
<p><strong>• Providing MIUI services.</strong> The following information: (device or SIM card-related information including GAID number, IMEI number, IMSI number, phone number, device ID, device operating system, MAC address, device type, system and performance information, and location information including mobile country code, mobile network code, location area code and cell identity), is used to activate MIUI services.</p>
<p><strong>• Diagnosing activation failures.</strong> Location-related information is used to access SIM card activation failure (e.g. Short Message Service (SMS) gateways and network failures) to identify the network operator of the service, and to notify the network operator of that failure.</p>
<p><strong>• Providing other MIUI services.</strong> Information collected when you use a MIUI service is used to perform the functions of that service, while providing service optimization, e.g. downloading, updating, registering, executing or optimizing activities related to MIUI services. For example, personal information collected by Themes may provide personalized theme recommendation services based on your downloading and browsing history.</p>
<p><strong>• Finding your device.</strong> If your phone is lost or stolen, Xiaomi's Find device feature can help you find and secure your phone. You can locate your phone on a map using location information provided by your phone, erase data remotely, or lock your phone. When you're actively looking for your phone, location information is captured from your mobile device; in some situations, this information is obtained from cell towers or Wi-Fi hotspots. You can turn this feature on or off at any time within the phone settings (Settings - Mi Account - Xiaomi Cloud - Find Device).</p>
<p><strong>• Recording location information in photos.</strong> You can record your location information while taking a photo. This information will be visible within your photo folders and the location will be saved in the metadata of your photos. If you do not wish to have your location recorded while taking a photo, you can turn this off at any time within the camera settings of the device.</p>
<p><strong>• Providing messaging functions</strong> (e.g. Mi Talk, Mi Message). If you download and use Mi Talk, information collected by Mi Talk may be used for activating this service and identifying the user and message recipient. In addition, chat history is stored for the convenience of re-loading chat history after a user has re-installed apps, or for synchronization across devices. Information (sender's and recipient's phone numbers and Mi Message IDs) may be used for Mi Message for activating the services and enabling the service to function, including routing of messages.</p>
<p><strong>• Providing location-based services.</strong> In the course of using MIUI services, location information may also be used by us or third party service providers and business partners (for more information see "<strong>How we share, transfer, and publicly disclose your personal information</strong>" below) to serve you the service and provide accurate details about that location for the best possible user experience, e.g. weather details, location access (as part of the Android platform). You may turn off location services in settings or turn off the use of location services of an app at any time.</p>
<p><strong>• Improving user experience through data, hardware, and software analysis.</strong> Some opt-in features, such as the User Experience Program, allow Xiaomi to analyze data about how users use the mobile phone, MIUI services, and other services provided by Xiaomi, so as to improve the user experience, such as sending crash reports. Xiaomi shall also conduct hardware and software analysis to further improve user experience.</p>
<p><strong>• Allowing you to use Security.</strong> Information collected may be used for security and system up-keeping functionalities in the Security app, such as Security scan, Battery saver, Blocklist, Cleaner, etc. Some of these functionalities are operated by third party service providers and/or business partners (for more information see "<strong>How we share, transfer, and publicly disclose your personal information</strong>" below). Information (which is not personal information like virus definition lists) is used for Security scan functions.</p>
<p><strong>• Providing push service.</strong> Mi Account ID , GAID, FCM token, Android ID, and Space ID (only on Xiaomi devices with Second space feature on) will also be used to provide the Xiaomi push service and Mi Notification Service to evaluate advertising performance and send notifications from MIUI about software updates or new product announcements, including information about sales and promotions. To provide the above service for you, application relevant information (app version ID, app package name), and device relevant information (model, brand) will also be collected. We may use your personal information for the purpose of sending you push messages (whether by messaging within our services, by email or by other means) that offer or advertise our products and services and/or the products and services of selected third parties. This is only done with your consent, where required under applicable laws. <strong>You may opt-out from receiving marketing information from us and third parties at any time by changing your preferences in the Settings, or managing your preferences through the third-party app/website using Xiaomi push.

<p><strong>• Providing personalized services and content, including ads.</strong> To protect your privacy, we do use a unique identifier rather than your name, email, or other information by which you can be directly identified, to provide you with personalized products, services and activities, including advertising.</p>
<p>We may combine this information with other information (including information across different services or devices such as computers, mobile phones, smart TVs, and other connected devices) to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.</p>
<p>For example, we may use your Mi Account details in all services you use that require a Mi Account. Furthermore, in order to improve your experience and our services, while complying with relevant laws and regulations and (where required) with your consent, we may sort out information from different products, services or equipment from you or related to you to form a label, to provide suggestions, customized content, and personalized features.</p>
<p>For the personalized ads, these would, for example, be provided based on your activities, usage, and preferences related to our apps and services. We create profiles by analyzing the aforementioned information and building segments (creating groups with specific shared characteristics) and by putting your personal information in one or more segments. Targeted advertising is only done with your consent, where required under applicable laws. You have the right to opt-out from receiving personalized advertisements and to object to profiling, including that carried out for direct marketing purposes, at any time.</p>

<h2>4 How we store and protect your personal information</h2>
<h3><strong>4.1 Xiaomi's security safeguards</strong></h3>
<p>We are committed to keeping your personal information secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure or other similar risks, we have put in place all legally required physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on your mobile device and on Xiaomi websites. We will ensure that we safeguard your personal information in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>For example, when you access your Mi Account, you can choose to use our two-step verification program for better security, and we highly recommend that you do so. When your personal information is transmitting between your Xiaomi device and our servers, we make sure the data is encrypted by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and appropriate encryption algorithms.</p>
<p>All your personal information is stored on secure servers, and protected in controlled facilities. We classify your information based on importance and sensitivity, and ensure that your personal information has the required level of security. We have special access controls for cloud-based data storage, and we regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against any unauthorized access and use.</p>
<p>We conduct due diligence on business partners and third party service providers to make sure that they are able to protect your personal information. We also check that appropriate security standards are maintained by these third parties by putting in place appropriate contractual restrictions, and where necessary, carrying out audits and assessments. In addition, our employees and those of our business partners and third party service providers who access your personal information are subject to enforceable contractual obligations of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We conduct security and privacy protection training courses and tests to enhance our employees' awareness of the importance of protecting personal information. We will take all practicable and legally required steps to safeguard your personal information. However, you should be aware that the use of the Internet is not entirely secure, and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal information when transferred from you or to you via the Internet.</p>
<p>We handle personal data breaches as required by applicable data protection law which includes, where required, notifying the breach to the relevant data protection supervisory authority and data subjects.</p>
<p>Our information security policies and procedures are designed with reference to international standards, and regularly pass third-party audits to verify the effectiveness of security measures. Xiaomi information system has obtained ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification for information security management systems (ISMS). Xiaomi e-commerce and Mi Home IoT platform have obtained ISO/IEC 27701:2019 certification for personal information management systems (PIMS). MIUI has obtained ISO/IEC 27018:2019 certification for public cloud personal information protection.</p>
<h3><strong>4.2 What you can do</strong></h3>
<p>You can set a unique password for Xiaomi by not disclosing your login password or account information to anybody (unless such a person is duly authorized by you) to avoid password leaks to other websites which may harm your account security at Xiaomi. Whenever possible, please do not disclose the verification code you received to anyone (including those who claim to be Xiaomi customer service). Whenever you sign in as a Mi Account user on Xiaomi websites, particularly on somebody else's computer or on public Internet terminals, you should always sign out at the end of your session.</p>
<p>Xiaomi cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by third party accessing your personal information as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private.

<h3><strong>4.4 Retention policy</strong></h3>
<p>We retain personal information for the period necessary for the purpose of the information collection described in this Privacy Policy or any separate privacy policy provided for a specific product or service, or as required by applicable laws. Detailed retention periods are specified in the specific service or related product page. We will cease to retain and delete or anonymize personal information once the purpose of collection is fulfilled, or after we confirm your request for erasure, or after we terminate the operation of the corresponding product or service. Where possible, we have indicated how long we typically retain identified categories, types or items of personal data. When deciding on these retention periods, we took into account the following criteria:</p>
<p>• the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data</p>

<p>• the purposes for which we process the personal data and how long we need the particular data to achieve these purposes</p>

<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, there may be an exception to this for personal information that we are processing for public interest, scientific, historical research, or statistical purposes.
