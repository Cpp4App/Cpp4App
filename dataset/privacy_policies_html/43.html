    How We Store and Protect Your Personal Information
</p>
<p>
    1. How we store your personal information
</p>
<p>
    The personal information collected with your consent will be stored in
    accordance with the laws and regulations on the personal privacy data
    protection of the countries concerned. To the extent not prohibited by
    local laws and regulations, we may also store the collected personal
    information in countries or regions outside the country where the business
    is located.
</p>
<p>
    Currently, Phone Master may store your personal information in: India,
    Ireland.
</p>
<p>
    In particular:
</p>
<p>
    The personal information collected and generated during our operations in
    India will be stored on servers located in India.
</p>
<p>
    The personal information collected and generated in our business outside
    India will be stored on servers in Ireland.
</p>
<p>
    According to business conditions, we may use servers in other regions or
    countries in the future, and we will update this Policy at that time.
</p>
<p>
    Whether we store personal information in the country where the business is
    located, or in other countries or regions to the extent that doing so does
    not violate laws and regulations, we will retain it in accordance with the
    relevant laws and regulations on data storage. At the same time, we will
    consider the characteristics, scope and purpose of personal information
    processing, the risks that may be encountered in the processing, and the
    serious consequences caused by the damage, etc., and implement the
    necessary security measures. For example, we will use encryption and
    de-identification methods to store the personal information collected. We
    will also keep the information for the shortest storage period specified by
    law. For those not specified by law, we will retain the information
    according to the shortest storage period required for business. For data
    that exceeds the storage period, or data that you request us to delete, we
    will delete said data accordingly or take other appropriate measures
    without violating the relevant laws and regulations.
</p>
<p>
    2. How we protect your personal information

    information and regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities
    and attacks, and we use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
    to protect your personal information by taking the types of the personal
    information, the processing, and the threats posed themselves into account.
    We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to keep your
    personal data secure.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, we need to remind you that no matter how perfect the measures
    are, there is no absolute guarantee of avoiding the occurrence of data
    storage security incidents. If a data breach event occurs, we will report
    it to the corresponding regulatory authorities as required by the relevant
    laws and regulations, and provide the type of personal data involved in the
    breach, the number of data subjects, the possible consequences of the
    breach, and the remedial measures we intend to take according to the
    requirements of the regulatory authorities. We will take the best possible
    measures to remedy or mitigate the damage and consequences of data breach.
    When permitted or required by laws and regulations, we will inform you of
    the possible consequences or significant damage to you in a timely manner,
    so that you can take appropriate measures promptly to protect your rights

    and wireless connections. In addition to the necessary protective measures
    we have taken, users have to strengthen the awareness of privacy security
    risks. For example, when you access third-party websites, links, products

    confidentiality agreements with authorized partners and require them to
    take relevant confidentiality and security measures to process personal
    information in accordance with this Policy and applicable laws in your
    jurisdiction. In addition, we will also require them to provide data
    security capabilities and information security qualifications (e.g., grade
    protection assessment, information security management system). When we

    security.

    also share your non-personal information with third parties. For example,
    we may use aggregated data to help partners (e.g., advertising service
    providers) understand the effectiveness, feedback and usage trends of their
    services.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a merger, acquisition or bankruptcy liquidation, asset
    transfer and other related transaction, if a personal information transfer
    is involved, we will require the new entity or organization holding your
    personal information to continue to be bound by this Policy through an
    agreement or other appropriate measures, and we will require such subject
    to take confidentiality and security measures of a degree no less than the
    requirements of this Policy to process personal information.

    also transfer your personal information to third-party service providers
    and business partners and your data may therefore also be transmitted to
    other countries or regions. The privacy protection laws of these countries
    or regions may be different, and the jurisdiction in which these global
    resources or servers are located may or may not protect personal
    information to the same standards as in your jurisdiction. However, we will
    still strive to comply with our Privacy Policy to protect your personal
    information, and we will follow the legal requirements of the country or
    region where the personal information is located to carry out the
    corresponding cross-border transfer and other processing of personal
    information.
</p>
<p>
    In the circumstance that we transfer personal information outside of your

    such transfers meet the requirements of applicable local data protection
    laws.
</p>
<p>

    Your Rights to Your Personal Information
</p>
<p>
    As a data subject, you have a series of rights to your personal
    information, including the right to confirm, access, correct, delete,
    withdraw consent, and lodge complaints (hereinafter referred to as
    "request"). We fully understand and respect your rights, and such rights
    will be subject to specific exclusions and exceptions under applicable

    effectively protected. However, please understand and note that for
    security reasons, we may need to verify your identity before processing
    your request. In principle, we do not charge a fee for your lawful and
    reasonable request, but we will charge a certain reasonable fee for
    repeated requests that exceed the reasonable limit where applicable, and
    based on actual administrative costs permitted by the applicable laws. We
    may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require excessive
    technical means (for example, to develop new systems or fundamentally
    change existing practices), pose risks to the legal rights of others or are
    extremely impractical, or violate the mandatory provisions by law.
</p>
<p>

    corrections or additions. You can directly correct or modify some of your
    personal information on the relevant product/service function pages. When
    your personal information collected by us has fulfilled the purpose of
    collection or is no longer required, or when you find that our collection
    and processing of your personal information violates the provisions of laws
    and regulations or this Privacy Policy, you have the right to ask us to

    obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with the
    applicable local law. Please also kindly note that if you request to delete
    your information from our products and services, we may not remove the
    corresponding information from the backup system immediately due to some
    applicable local laws and technological limitations, however, we will
    securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
    processing until the backup is updating or can be deleted or be made
    anonymous.

<p>
    If you withdraw your consent, you may not be able to continue receiving the
    part and/or full benefit of Phone Master and its Service. The withdrawal of

    processing activities based on your consent.

    us an email at privacy@transsion.com. We will respond promptly after

    your local statutory personal data protection department, or file a lawsuit
    with a competent court.
</p>
<p>
    6.5Right to control your privacy settings
</p>
<p>
    You have the right to control your privacy settings and restrict our
    collection, use, disclosure, or processing of your personal information via

    interception" &gt; "Intercepting rules" to stop the data collection and
    processing of the harassment interception features.
